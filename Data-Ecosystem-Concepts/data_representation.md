# Data Representation  

## Definition  
Data representation refers to how data is formatted and stored for processing, making it easier to interpret, exchange, and analyze. Different formats allow data to be structured in ways that meet specific needs.

**e.g.:** At myPizza bakery, data about customer orders, payment methods, and inventory are stored and exchanged in various formats for different purposes.

# Key Formats for Data Representation  

## 1. Binary Formats  
- Data is represented as sequences of 0s and 1s, typically for efficiency in storage or transmission.
- **e.g.:** Storing images or pizza recipe files in binary format to save space and improve speed of access on myPizza bakery's system.

## 2. Text Formats  

### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
- A lightweight, easy-to-read text format for structuring data in key-value pairs.
- **e.g.:** myPizza bakery using JSON to store and transfer customer order details, such as pizza type, toppings, and delivery address.

### XML (Extensible Markup Language)
- A flexible, hierarchical text format that uses tags to define data structures.
- **e.g.:** myPizza bakery might use XML to structure data for generating invoices or export data to external suppliers for inventory restocking.

## 3. Relational Formats (Tables)  
- Data is organized into rows and columns, typically used in databases for efficient querying and analysis.
- **e.g.:** myPizza bakery storing sales data in relational database tables (e.g., SQL) where each row represents an individual sale, and each column contains specific details like pizza type, price, and date of sale.

## Importance of Data Representation  
Choosing the appropriate format for data representation ensures efficient storage, accurate data exchange, and effective analysis.

**e.g.:** At myPizza bakery, using JSON for online order data and relational tables for sales tracking enables smooth integration with the website and robust analysis of business performance.
