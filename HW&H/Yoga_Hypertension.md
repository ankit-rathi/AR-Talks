## Physiological & Psychological Changes Over Time

| Timeframe | Physiological Changes | Psychological / Mental Changes | What’s Happening Internally |
|---------|----------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Days 2–7** | • Fewer sudden BP spikes  <br>• Steadier pulse  <br>• Improved digestion (less gas/acidity)  <br>• Better sleep onset | • Reduced inner urgency  <br>• Calmer baseline mood  <br>• Less irritability  <br>• Clearer thinking post-practice | Sympathetic overdrive reduces; vagal braking begins |
| **Weeks 2–3** | • **Diastolic BP drops first (↓ 4–8 mmHg)**  <br>• BP readings less variable  <br>• Reduced chest tightness  <br>• Softer morning BP surge | • Less anxiety around BP readings  <br>• Better stress tolerance  <br>• Improved emotional control | Vascular tone normalizes; parasympathetic tone strengthens |
| **Weeks 4–6** | • **Systolic BP reduction (↓ 6–12 mmHg)**  <br>• Better kidney perfusion  <br>• Reduced sodium/water retention  <br>• Improved workout recovery | • More stable mood  <br>• Reduced reliance on stimulants  <br>• Better focus without tension | RAAS signaling calms; cortisol lowers; NO availability improves |
| **Months 2–3** | • BP becomes stable & predictable  <br>• Less reactivity to stress/sleep loss  <br>• Improved pulse pressure (arterial flexibility)  <br>• Lower inflammation | • Reduced health anxiety  <br>• Stronger mind–body confidence  <br>• Sense of control & calm | Autonomic baseline resets; natural BP regulation dominates |
| **Beyond 3 months** | • Sustained BP control  <br>• Improved vascular health  <br>• Possible medication taper readiness* | • Normalized relationship with BP  <br>• Emotional resilience | System-wide reconditioning completed |

## Key Patterns to Remember (For You)

| Observation | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Diastolic improves first | Nervous system tone is correcting |
| BP variability reduces | Regulation > suppression |
| Sleep improves before BP | Autonomic reset precedes numbers |
| Occasional “bad” readings | Normal recalibration phase |

## Simple Rule of Thumb

> **If you feel calmer, sleep better, and BP becomes less reactive — you are winning, even before numbers look perfect.**
