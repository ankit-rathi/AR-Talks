Outline for Health

Health is number one priority in life.

Not just physical, but also mental and spiritual well-being.

Play a sport instead of exercise.

Walk barefoot, expose yourself to sunlight, cold and rain.

Stay in natural environment, even if it is not sterile and clean, it trains your immune system.

Stay in smaller tribes, mainly surrounded by family members,  friends and relatives.

Learn to say no to prioritize well being.

In nature, it’s very rare to find carbs and fat together, avoid them together.

Most fit and healthy people focus much more on what they eat than how much. 

“Easy choices, hard life. Hard choices, easy life.”
