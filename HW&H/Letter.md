**Hey Aarsh,**

I wanted to write this instead of saying it out loud — not because I want to lecture you, but because sometimes when we talk, it feels like we’re both defending our side instead of really hearing each other. And I don’t want that.

I know you feel like we’re always trying to control you — your phone time, games, social media, studies, even how you spend your day. I can imagine how annoying and unfair that must feel. Honestly, if I were in your place, I’d probably be frustrated too.

But here’s what’s real for us — we’re not doing this because we want to control your life. We’re doing it because we **care too much to stay silent**.

You’re growing up in a world that’s very different from the one we grew up in — screens, games, dopamine hits, social media pressure. It’s powerful, addictive, and tricky, especially when your brain (with its super-fast thinking and curiosity) craves stimulation all the time. That’s actually what makes you creative and quick — but it also makes you more vulnerable to distractions and burnout.

So when we set limits, it’s not because we don’t trust you. It’s because we want to **help you build control over your own brain**, not let these apps or games control it for you.

We also know how talented and capable you are — and it hurts to see your time and energy get pulled in too many directions. You have so much potential, and we just want you to feel proud of what you can do when your mind is clear and focused.

Here’s what we’d like to do: instead of us setting all the rules, **let’s work together**.  
You tell us what freedom you want, and we’ll tell you what worries us. We can make a plan that feels fair, gives you space, and still keeps you safe and balanced.

We’ll make mistakes — all of us. But we’ll keep learning together.  
Because this isn’t “us versus you.” It’s **us with you** — always.

Love,  
**Mom and Dad**
