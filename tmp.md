Project Background & Scope: Business Requirements
As part of compliance with the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) introduced by the European Union, the Bank is required to maintain and annually submit a comprehensive register of contractual arrangements with ICT third-party service providers. This register must be available at the entity, sub-consolidated, and consolidated levels and submitted to the European Central Bank (ECB).

Currently, the process of preparing this register is entirely manual, involving the collection, consolidation, and validation of data across disparate systems and teams. This manual approach is time-consuming, prone to errors, and lacks traceability, making it inefficient and potentially non-compliant under DORAâ€™s operational resilience requirements.

To address this, the proposed solution aims to automate the report generation process by integrating with internal systems such as Operations Assets and Internal Service Management (ISM) platforms. The solution will enable:

Ingestion of data from multiple sources

Automated validation against defined rules and quality checks

Generation of standardized reports in the ECB-required format via API-based file output

Support for monthly internal runs to ensure accuracy, traceability, and internal governance ahead of the formal annual submission

The project scope focuses on delivering a resilient, auditable, and scalable reporting solution that ensures compliance with DORA's third-party risk reporting mandates while improving operational efficiency and reducing manual dependency.
