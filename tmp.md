# Thoughts on Move Data with Confidence

## What Should Be Done One Time During the Testing Phase?
### Completeness Testing:

#### Row Count Validation:
- Compare the total number of rows in the source table with the number of rows in Snowflake after transfer.
- Validate the row count for each batch or partition during the transfer process.
#### Column Count Validation:
- Ensure all 400 columns from the source table are present in Snowflake without omissions or additions.
#### Null Value Checks:
- Compare the count of NULLs per column between the source and destination to ensure accuracy.
#### Log Analysis:
Review logs from the data pipeline to ensure no errors or interruptions occurred during the transfer.

Accuracy Testing:

Field-Level Comparison:
Randomly select a sample of rows and compare each field value between the source and Snowflake.
Use automated scripts to compare field-level data for all rows to ensure no discrepancies.
Data Type Validation:
Ensure data types in Snowflake match those in the source system.
Numeric Precision and Scale Checks:
Validate that the precision and scale of numeric fields are maintained.
Transformation Logic Validation:
Validate that any transformation logic is correctly applied during the move.
Timeliness Testing:

Latency Measurement:
Measure the time taken for each batch of data to move from the source to Snowflake and compare it with the expected timelines.
End-to-End Transfer Time:
Validate that the entire dataset is transferred within the agreed SLA.
Time Stamping:
Ensure timestamps on data are preserved and accurate in Snowflake.

## What Controls Should Be a Part of the Production Data Pipeline?
Completeness Controls:

Checksum/Hash Totals:
Generate and compare checksum/hash totals for each row or batch between the source and Snowflake.
Audit Tables:
Maintain audit tables to log the number of rows and batches processed, ensuring traceability.
Retry Mechanism:
Implement a retry mechanism to reprocess any failed or incomplete batches automatically.
Accuracy Controls:

Pre and Post Transformation Validation:
Validate data before and after transformations to ensure they are correctly applied.
Data Mapping Verification:
Cross-verify each field in the source with the corresponding field in Snowflake.
Automated Data Validation Scripts:
Implement scripts to automatically compare and validate data at the field level between the source and Snowflake.
Timeliness Controls:

SLA Monitoring:
Implement monitoring to ensure the data pipeline meets the expected SLA, with alerts for any delays.
Batch Transfer Monitoring:
Continuously monitor the progress of each batch, logging start and end times to identify bottlenecks.
Parallel Processing:
Use parallel processing to move multiple batches simultaneously to meet timeliness requirements.
Recovery Procedures:
Define recovery procedures for delays or failures, including automatic reruns and manual intervention protocols.

## RAID Items to Achieve the Above Data Transfer Objectives
1. Risks
Data Loss During Transfer:

Risk of losing data during the transfer from SAS/Oracle to AWS S3 or from S3 to Snowflake due to network interruptions or system failures.
Mitigation: Implement checksum/hash total validation, row count checks, and a retry mechanism in the pipeline.
Data Corruption:

Risk of data corruption during the transformation or transfer process.
Mitigation: Implement field-level comparisons, data type validations, and pre/post transformation validations.
Performance Bottlenecks:

Risk of the data pipeline not meeting SLA due to network bandwidth issues or processing delays.
Mitigation: Use parallel processing, batch monitoring, and SLA monitoring to ensure timely data transfer.
Incomplete Data Migration:

Risk of not all rows or columns being transferred to Snowflake, resulting in incomplete data.
Mitigation: Conduct comprehensive row count, column count, and null value checks during testing, and use audit tables in production.
2. Assumptions
Consistent Data Schema:

Assume that the data schema and format are consistent across the source (SAS/Oracle), AWS S3, and Snowflake.
Action: Validate schema alignment before starting the transfer process.
Sufficient Network Bandwidth:

Assume the network has sufficient bandwidth to handle large data transfers without significant delays.
Action: Conduct a bandwidth test and ensure reliable network infrastructure.
Data Storage Capacity:

Assume AWS S3 and Snowflake have adequate storage and processing capacity to handle the data volume.
Action: Ensure resource allocation is adequate for the data transfer requirements.
3. Issues
Data Transformation Errors:

Potential issues with data transformation, leading to incorrect data types or values.
Resolution: Implement transformation logic validation and automated data validation scripts to catch and correct errors.
Unexpected Downtime:

Unexpected downtime of SAS/Oracle, AWS, or Snowflake systems during data transfer.
Resolution: Establish backup systems and recovery procedures to handle downtime and prevent data loss.
Inaccurate Timeliness Metrics:

Timeliness metrics not being accurately measured or monitored, leading to SLA breaches.
Resolution: Implement robust monitoring and logging systems to track and alert on transfer times.
4. Dependencies
Data Source Availability:

Dependence on the availability and accessibility of SAS/Oracle systems to extract data.
Management: Schedule data extraction during low-usage periods and coordinate with IT teams to ensure system availability.
Network Reliability:

Dependence on the reliability of the network for transferring data from on-prem systems to AWS S3 and then to Snowflake.
Management: Ensure a stable and high-bandwidth network connection, and have failover options in place.
Processing Power in Snowflake:

Dependence on Snowflakeâ€™s processing power to handle the incoming data and perform necessary transformations.
Management: Allocate sufficient resources in Snowflake to process data in a timely manner.
These RAID items help in identifying and managing risks, assumptions, issues, and dependencies, ensuring that the data transfer from SAS/Oracle to Snowflake via AWS S3 is successful and meets the CAT (Completeness, Accuracy, and Timeliness) requirements.
