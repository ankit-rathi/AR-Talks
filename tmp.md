I need to estimate the efforts of building dashboards on Tableau with data warehouse on Snowflake, I also need to figure out relevant data sources in my organization and make sure we have all the raw data points needed for the dashboards, how should I approach the estimation?

there are 3 business areas for which I need to prepare dashboards and each area has its own data source, there are 4-5 dashboards for each business area. we have two resources, one snowflake/db and another tableau resource.
