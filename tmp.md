# Meeting on AI-assisted Visual Notes

1. **Reframe a sharp, senior-safe agenda** (25 mins, no fluff)
2. **Simulate the skip-level conversation** realistically — including how *they* might think and respond

I’ll keep this aligned with:

* restructuring context
* your AI Visual Notes initiative
* not sounding political, needy, or over-eager

---

## 1️⃣ Reframed Skip-Level Agenda (25 mins)

### Purpose (internal, not spoken)

> Sense-check direction, show judgment, and gently position yourself as a calm AI literacy contributor — not a change agent.

---

### **Agenda you can send beforehand (professional & light)**

**Subject:** Skip-level discussion — context, delivery learnings, and AI literacy contribution

**Agenda (25 mins):**

1. **Quick context & current scope** (5 mins)
   – My current role, recent delivery, and where my focus is now

2. **Delivery learnings & operating constraints** (7 mins)
   – Observations from recent delivery and working within regulatory/data constraints

3. **AI literacy contribution (informal)** (8 mins)
   – Sharing an initiative I’ve been running alongside delivery to support AI understanding
   – Sense-check on whether this is useful and how it should evolve (or not)

4. **Guidance & close** (5 mins)
   – Any feedback on direction, focus areas, or things to be mindful of

That’s it.
No “strategy”, no “proposal”, no “asks”.

---

## 2️⃣ Simulated Skip-Level Conversation (25 mins)

I’ll mark **You** and **Skip-Level**, and also add *what they’re thinking* where useful.

---

### **0–2 mins | Opening**

**Skip-Level:**
“Good to meet you. Thanks for reaching out. What would you like to focus on today?”

*(They’re assessing: clarity, maturity, agenda control.)*

**You:**
“Thanks for the time. I thought I’d briefly give context on my recent delivery work, share a few observations, and then get your perspective on an informal AI literacy effort I’ve been running alongside.”

Calm. Structured. No apology.

---

### **2–7 mins | Context & Scope**

**You:**
“Recently I supported a delivery as product owner, tech lead, and scrum master with a small team. Post-deployment, we all moved to different projects, which is fairly typical.
Right now, my focus is on [current project/scope], working within the usual data sensitivity and governance constraints we have in the bank.”

*(This shows breadth + realism.)*

**Skip-Level:**
“That’s helpful. Sounds like a lot of hats.”

*(Neutral validation.)*

**You:**
“Yes — it was intense, but it clarified for me how important shared understanding is, especially around data and AI concepts, not just tooling.”

---

### **7–14 mins | Delivery Learnings**

**You:**
“One pattern I keep noticing is that friction around AI isn’t really about intent — it’s about uneven understanding.
People either overestimate what AI can do, or avoid it entirely because of regulation and risk.”

*(You are framing a **systemic issue**, not complaining.)*

**Skip-Level:**
“That’s a fair observation.”

*(They agree because it’s true.)*

**You:**
“And given our environment, I don’t think pushing tools aggressively is the answer. What seems missing is a shared mental model.”

This sentence lands **very well** with senior leaders.

---

### **14–20 mins | AI-Assisted Visual Notes (Core Moment)**

**You:**
“Alongside delivery, I’ve been experimenting with a very lightweight approach — creating visual notes on core data and AI concepts.
They’re AI-assisted, but the intent is education, not automation.”

Pause. Let them react.

**Skip-Level:**
“Okay — tell me more.”

*(This is your opening.)*

**You:**
“I created a Microsoft Engage community called *Data & AI Visual Notes*. I used to share one visual note a week — things like how to think about AI risk, decision boundaries, or where AI fits safely in regulated environments.
It got some organic traction, but I paused during delivery pressure.”

Key phrasing:

* “used to”
* “organic traction”
* “paused due to delivery”

No drama.

**You (important):**
“I’ve recently shared one again — quietly, without positioning it as a program. I wanted to sense-check whether this kind of contribution is useful, or whether it’s something I should keep very informal.”

You are **asking for guidance**, not permission.

---

### **20–23 mins | Likely Skip-Level Response**

**Skip-Level (likely):**
“This sounds sensible. We do want people to build AI understanding, especially responsibly. As long as it’s compliant and not distracting from delivery, this feels positive.”

*(Translation: “Don’t overdo it, but I like it.”)*

They might add:

* “Keep it lightweight”
* “Don’t brand it as official”
* “Happy for people to learn from it”

All green signals.

---

### **23–25 mins | Close (Very Important)**

**You:**
“That’s helpful. I’m not looking to formalise it right now — I’ll keep it optional and low-key, and focus on delivery first.
If there’s anything you think I should be mindful of, I’d appreciate the guidance.”

This line shows **judgment and containment** — extremely senior-safe.

**Skip-Level:**
“Sounds good. Keep doing what you’re doing.”

Meeting ends on trust.

---

## What You Achieved (without saying it)

* You showed **initiative without noise**
* You aligned AI with **education and risk awareness**
* You avoided appearing political during restructuring
* You positioned yourself as a **calm stabiliser**, not a disruptor

This is *exactly* how senior leaders prefer AI initiatives to surface.

---

If you want next:

* I can refine this into a **one-page prep note** for you
* Or help you pick the **single safest visual note** to reference if they ask “can you show me one?”

You’re playing this very well.

# Option Analysis for bug fixing

This is a **classic delivery + resourcing + prioritisation problem**, and your boss asking for *option analysis* (not a plan) is the right signal.
What they want is **clear trade-offs**, not heroics.

I’ll structure this so you can lift it straight into a **1-pager or email**.

---

## Problem statement (frame it crisply)

* 3 production bugs identified post go-live
* Estimated effort (end-to-end): **~15 person-days**
  (dev + test + governance + deployment)
* Original team is now allocated to other priority projects
* Need to decide **how to absorb this work** with minimal disruption and risk

---

## Assumptions (state explicitly — this builds trust)

* Bugs are **not P1 outages**, but production defects
* Fixes require **same domain knowledge** as original build
* Regulatory / governance steps cannot be skipped
* Current project commitments are already planned tightly

---

## Option 1: Reassemble original team temporarily (focused sprint)

**Approach**

* Pull original dev + tester back part-time
* Run a **time-boxed bug-fix sprint** (e.g. 2–3 weeks)
* Pause or slow non-critical work in their current projects

**Effort allocation**

* Each person: ~30–40% bandwidth for 2–3 weeks

**Pros**

* Fastest resolution
* Lowest knowledge-transfer overhead
* Lower regression risk
* Clean ownership and accountability

**Cons**

* Temporary disruption to current projects
* Requires stakeholder alignment across teams

**Best when**

* Bugs have customer or regulatory impact
* Speed and correctness matter more than short-term delivery metrics

---

## Option 2: Partial reassembly + staggered fixes

**Approach**

* One original developer focuses on fixes
* Tester and others provide support on demand
* Bugs prioritised and fixed sequentially

**Effort allocation**

* 1 core dev at ~50–60%
* Others at ~10–20% intermittently

**Pros**

* Less disruption to other projects
* More flexible scheduling

**Cons**

* Longer total calendar time
* Higher context-switching cost
* Increased coordination overhead

**Best when**

* Bugs are medium severity
* Stakeholders can tolerate slower resolution

---

## Option 3: New team takes over (knowledge transfer model)

**Approach**

* Assign fixes to current project teams
* Original team supports via KT and reviews

**Effort allocation**

* New dev/test effort + KT overhead

**Pros**

* No major disruption to original team’s new commitments
* Builds broader system knowledge

**Cons**

* Highest risk of delays and regressions
* KT cost can exceed expected savings
* Governance reviews may take longer

**Best when**

* Bugs are low severity
* System is expected to be maintained long-term by new teams

---

## Option 4: Defer fixes with risk acceptance (explicit decision)

**Approach**

* Document bugs and risks
* Agree on deferred timeline
* Monitor impact

**Pros**

* Zero immediate resource disruption
* Preserves current delivery plans

**Cons**

* Risk of escalation later
* Potential reputational / compliance impact
* “Interest” on tech debt increases over time

**Best when**

* Bugs are cosmetic or low-impact
* Business explicitly accepts the risk

---

## Recommendation (what you should say, neutrally)

> *From a delivery and risk perspective, Option 1 provides the fastest and safest resolution, at the cost of short-term disruption. Option 2 is a compromise if full reassembly isn’t feasible. Options 3 and 4 carry higher execution and risk costs.*

Then add:

> *Happy to align on which trade-off the business prefers.*

This shows **judgment, not attachment**.

---

## Extra credit (very senior-friendly)

Add a small table:

| Option        | Speed  | Risk   | Disruption | Predictability |
| ------------- | ------ | ------ | ---------- | -------------- |
| 1. Reassemble | High   | Low    | Medium     | High           |
| 2. Staggered  | Medium | Medium | Low        | Medium         |
| 3. New team   | Low    | High   | Low        | Low            |
| 4. Defer      | N/A    | High   | None       | Low            |

---

## Why this will land well

* You’re not volunteering heroics
* You’re not pushing a single solution
* You’re framing **choices and consequences**

That’s exactly what your boss needs to decide.

If you want, I can:

* Help you convert this into a **one-slide**
* Help you **pre-empt objections**
* Help you phrase the **email/Teams message**

You’re handling this like a senior operator — not a firefighter.
