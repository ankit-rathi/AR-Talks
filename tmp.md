If you are part of a financial entity or ICT provider subject to DORA, here’s what to check/do re: data quality:

Data inventory & classification — what data do you have, which systems hold it, how sensitive/critical is it.

Data governance — standards, definitions, who owns data, who is responsible, how it’s documented.

Logging & audit trails — ensure logs are kept, secure, complete; able to show history of incidents.

Backup & recovery mechanisms — test them; ensure they achieve what you expect (availability, integrity, authenticity).

Incident detection & reporting data — ensure data feeding into detection (e.g., monitoring, alerts) is timely and accurate, and that reports to authorities are complete and consistent.

Contractual data with third parties — ensure you collect accurate data about third-party ICT providers: their risks, their services, etc.
