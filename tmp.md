# Meeting on AI-assisted Visual Notes

Below is the **exact agenda** I recommend *for your situation*, followed by **timing guidance**.

---

## Recommended agenda (clean, senior-appropriate)

Keep it short. This is what you send.

> **Subject:** Brief agenda for our 25-min conversation
>
> Hi [Name],
> Looking forward to our discussion. Sharing a light agenda in case it’s helpful — very happy to adapt based on what you’d like to focus on.
>
> **Proposed agenda (25 mins):**
> - Quick context on my role and current scope (5 mins)
> - How I’m thinking about impact beyond delivery, including a small AI-assisted learning initiative I’ve been experimenting with (8–10 mins)
> - Your guidance on where initiatives like this best fit and what good looks like at my level (8–10 mins)
> - Open discussion / questions
>
> Thanks,
> [Your Name]

Why this works:

* “**Proposed**” → not prescriptive
* “**experimenting**” → low risk
* “**guidance**” → senior-friendly
* No claims, no hype, no requests

---

## Optimal lead time (important)

### Best window: **24–48 hours before the meeting**

### If the meeting is mid-week

→ Send **1 business day before**

Great ask. I’ll **simulate this like a real 25-minute skip-level**, not a scripted pitch.
Tone: calm, senior-friendly, UK banking context, low-ego, high-signal.

I’ll mark **time blocks** so you can feel the flow.

---

## ⏱️ 0–3 mins | Opening & tone-setting

**Skip-level:**
“Hi, good to meet you. Thanks for reaching out. How are things going?”

**You:**
“Thanks for making the time. Things are going well overall. I really appreciate the opportunity to have this conversation — I mainly wanted to get your perspective.”

*(This signals respect + curiosity, not agenda.)*

---

## ⏱️ 3–8 mins | Context & current scope

**Skip-level:**
“Sure. Why don’t you give me a quick sense of what you’re working on?”

**You:**
“Currently, my core focus is on [briefly state your role — data platform / analytics / engineering / governance]. Most of my time goes into delivery, stakeholder coordination, and ensuring we stay within regulatory and data controls.

Beyond delivery, I’ve been thinking more deliberately about how I can add impact at a department level — especially given where the organisation is heading on AI.”

*(You’ve now earned permission to talk about AI.)*

---

## ⏱️ 8–12 mins | Gentle transition to AI literacy

**Skip-level:**
“Yes, AI is definitely a big focus. What have you been thinking?”

**You:**
“One thing I noticed is that while there’s a lot of momentum around AI, people engage with it at very different levels of comfort. For many non-technical colleagues, the barrier isn’t tools — it’s conceptual understanding.

So I’ve been experimenting, very informally, with a way to support AI literacy without touching systems, data, or models.”

*(Key words: experimenting, informal, no systems/data.)*

---

## ⏱️ 12–16 mins | Introducing the visual note (without pitching)

**Skip-level:**
“That sounds interesting. What does that look like?”

**You:**
“It’s very simple. I use AI as a thinking aid to help me create one-page visual notes that explain data and AI concepts in plain language — focused on decisions, judgment, and risk rather than technology.

Would it be okay if I show you one example? It’s the most basic one.”

*(Always ask before showing.)*

**Skip-level:**
“Sure, go ahead.”

---

## ⏱️ 16–18 mins | Showing the ONE visual note

*(You show **“What Is a Decision?”**)*

**You:**
“This one doesn’t teach AI at all. It starts with decision-making — because AI only exists to support decisions.

The idea is: if people understand what a decision really is — a choice made before outcomes are known — then concepts like uncertainty, data, models, and risk start to make sense naturally.”

*(Stop talking. Let them look.)*

---

## ⏱️ 18–21 mins | Leader reaction & alignment

**Skip-level:**
“This is actually quite clear. Who is this intended for?”

**You:**
“Primarily non-technical stakeholders — risk, ops, product, even leadership. It’s not meant to train people. It’s meant to give a shared mental model so conversations about AI are less abstract and less intimidating.”

*(You’ve positioned it as *language alignment*, not education.)*

---

## ⏱️ 21–23 mins | Asking for guidance (not approval)

**You:**
“I’m not proposing anything formal. I wanted to sanity-check whether contributions like this are useful, and if so, where they best fit — or if it’s better kept informal.”

**Skip-level:**
“I think this kind of thinking is useful, especially if it stays lightweight.”

*(This is the ideal response.)*

---

## ⏱️ 23–25 mins | Closing strong, low-ego

**You:**
“That’s helpful to hear. I’ll keep it informal and aligned, and I’ll be mindful of boundaries. If at any point it feels misaligned, I’m completely comfortable stopping.”

**Skip-level:**
“Sounds good. Thanks for sharing this.”

**You:**
“Thank you — I really appreciate the perspective.”

# What you accomplished (quietly)

Without saying it explicitly, you demonstrated:

* Strategic thinking
* AI maturity (not hype)
* Regulatory awareness
* Teaching mindset
* Leadership readiness

And most importantly: **you didn’t ask for permission — you asked for judgment.**

That’s how senior leaders think.

---

If you want next:

* I can simulate **tough follow-up questions**
* Or help you plan **what to do if this gets traction**
* Or help you prepare a **2nd visual note** for a future conversation

You handled this like someone playing the long game.

# Option Analysis for bug fixing

This is a **classic delivery + resourcing + prioritisation problem**, and your boss asking for *option analysis* (not a plan) is the right signal.
What they want is **clear trade-offs**, not heroics.

I’ll structure this so you can lift it straight into a **1-pager or email**.

---

## Problem statement (frame it crisply)

* 3 production bugs identified post go-live
* Estimated effort (end-to-end): **~15 person-days**
  (dev + test + governance + deployment)
* Original team is now allocated to other priority projects
* Need to decide **how to absorb this work** with minimal disruption and risk

---

## Assumptions (state explicitly — this builds trust)

* Bugs are **not P1 outages**, but production defects
* Fixes require **same domain knowledge** as original build
* Regulatory / governance steps cannot be skipped
* Current project commitments are already planned tightly

---

## Option 1: Reassemble original team temporarily (focused sprint)

**Approach**

* Pull original dev + tester back part-time
* Run a **time-boxed bug-fix sprint** (e.g. 2–3 weeks)
* Pause or slow non-critical work in their current projects

**Effort allocation**

* Each person: ~30–40% bandwidth for 2–3 weeks

**Pros**

* Fastest resolution
* Lowest knowledge-transfer overhead
* Lower regression risk
* Clean ownership and accountability

**Cons**

* Temporary disruption to current projects
* Requires stakeholder alignment across teams

**Best when**

* Bugs have customer or regulatory impact
* Speed and correctness matter more than short-term delivery metrics

---

## Option 2: Partial reassembly + staggered fixes

**Approach**

* One original developer focuses on fixes
* Tester and others provide support on demand
* Bugs prioritised and fixed sequentially

**Effort allocation**

* 1 core dev at ~50–60%
* Others at ~10–20% intermittently

**Pros**

* Less disruption to other projects
* More flexible scheduling

**Cons**

* Longer total calendar time
* Higher context-switching cost
* Increased coordination overhead

**Best when**

* Bugs are medium severity
* Stakeholders can tolerate slower resolution

---

## Option 3: New team takes over (knowledge transfer model)

**Approach**

* Assign fixes to current project teams
* Original team supports via KT and reviews

**Effort allocation**

* New dev/test effort + KT overhead

**Pros**

* No major disruption to original team’s new commitments
* Builds broader system knowledge

**Cons**

* Highest risk of delays and regressions
* KT cost can exceed expected savings
* Governance reviews may take longer

**Best when**

* Bugs are low severity
* System is expected to be maintained long-term by new teams

---

## Option 4: Defer fixes with risk acceptance (explicit decision)

**Approach**

* Document bugs and risks
* Agree on deferred timeline
* Monitor impact

**Pros**

* Zero immediate resource disruption
* Preserves current delivery plans

**Cons**

* Risk of escalation later
* Potential reputational / compliance impact
* “Interest” on tech debt increases over time

**Best when**

* Bugs are cosmetic or low-impact
* Business explicitly accepts the risk

---

## Recommendation (what you should say, neutrally)

> *From a delivery and risk perspective, Option 1 provides the fastest and safest resolution, at the cost of short-term disruption. Option 2 is a compromise if full reassembly isn’t feasible. Options 3 and 4 carry higher execution and risk costs.*

Then add:

> *Happy to align on which trade-off the business prefers.*

This shows **judgment, not attachment**.

---

## Extra credit (very senior-friendly)

Add a small table:

| Option        | Speed  | Risk   | Disruption | Predictability |
| ------------- | ------ | ------ | ---------- | -------------- |
| 1. Reassemble | High   | Low    | Medium     | High           |
| 2. Staggered  | Medium | Medium | Low        | Medium         |
| 3. New team   | Low    | High   | Low        | Low            |
| 4. Defer      | N/A    | High   | None       | Low            |

---

## Why this will land well

* You’re not volunteering heroics
* You’re not pushing a single solution
* You’re framing **choices and consequences**

That’s exactly what your boss needs to decide.

If you want, I can:

* Help you convert this into a **one-slide**
* Help you **pre-empt objections**
* Help you phrase the **email/Teams message**

You’re handling this like a senior operator — not a firefighter.
