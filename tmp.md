This session provides a deep exploration of **Vedanta**, centering on its definitions, its non-dualistic core (Advaita), and its practical application in the modern world.

### **The Definition and Scope of Vedanta**
*   **Vedanta is the heart of Hinduism.** It is not just one sect but the underlying philosophy for nearly all Hindu traditions, including well-known groups like ISKCON and the Swaminarayan sect. 
*   **The "Cutting Edge" of Knowledge.** While often viewed as an ancient philosophy, the word *Vedanta* can be translated as the "final conclusion" or even the **"cutting edge" of knowledge** (*Veda* meaning knowledge and *Anta* meaning edge).
*   **The Triple Foundation (Prasthanatraya).** The philosophy is built upon three pillars:
    1.  **The Upanishads:** The primary source of spiritual knowledge.
    2.  **The Bhagavad Gita:** The essence of the Upanishads' teachings.
    3.  **The Brahma Sutras:** The logical and rational framework that systematizes these mystical teachings.

### **The Nature of the Spiritual Journey**
*   **A journey from ignorance to knowledge.** Unlike many religious frameworks that view spirituality as a journey in **space** (going to heaven) or **time** (seeing God after death), Vedanta asserts that the reality it speaks of is **here and now**.
*   **Beyond Space, Time, and Object.** Vedanta describes a reality that is not limited by location, time, or the distinction between different things. It is a journey of **realization** rather than a physical or temporal transition.
*   **Distinction from other paths.** While Vedanta utilizes tools like morality (*dharma*), devotion (*bhakti*), and meditation (*yoga*), its core is none of these—it is specifically the path of **knowledge** (*Jnana*).

### **The Core Insight: "Tat Tvam Asi" (That Thou Art)**
*   **The Synthesis of God and Self.** The fundamental teaching of Advaita Vedanta is that the **Infinite Reality** (Brahman or "That") and your **Individual Self** (Atman or "Thou") are identical. 
*   **Solving the Paradox of Existence.** The "God-centered" approach in religion often suffers from doubt regarding God’s existence, while the "Self-centered" approach suffers from the "miserable" reality of human problems. Vedanta merges these: it takes the **undoubted certainty** of your own existence and identifies it with the **infinitude** of the Divine.
*   **The Witness Consciousness.** You are not the body, the mind, or the intellect; you are the **witness** of these states, which remain unchanged through waking, dreaming, and deep sleep.

### **Practical Vedanta and Ethics**
*   **The Foundation of Morality.** Swami Vivekananda emphasized that Vedanta is the only true basis for ethics. Because existence is **one**, hurting another is literally hurting yourself.
*   **Strength and Unselfishness.** Practical Vedanta is defined by strength; Vivekananda taught to reject anything that weakens you as "poison". Unselfishness is the natural result of realizing your oneness with others.
*   **Service as Worship (Shiva Jnana Jiva Seva).** True spirituality is expressed by finding peace within when your eyes are closed and asking **"What can I do for you?"** when your eyes are open—treating every being as a manifestation of the Divine.
