The latest session features a conversation with **Barry McCardel**, co-founder and CEO of **Hex**, who discusses the evolution of data tools, the shift from machine learning (ML) skepticism to AI advocacy, and the importance of customer-centric product development.

### **The Origin and Mission of Hex**
*   **Solving the "Menagerie" of Tools:** The idea for Hex was born from the frustration of using a fragmented data stack—where work was scattered across SQL queries, spreadsheets, and Jupyter notebooks—and sharing results via static screenshots and PDFs.
*   **Beyond the Static Dashboard:** Hex was designed to capture the **iterative, exploratory flow** of a notebook while providing more structure than traditional open-source tools.
*   **Reluctant Founders:** Unlike founders who look for a problem to solve, the Hex team were "reluctant founders" who worked together at Palantir and felt compelled to build the tool they personally needed as data buyers.

### **The Evolution of AI: From Skepticism to Zealotry**
*   **The ML Skeptic (2020):** In 2020, Barry was skeptical of ML because, historically, getting models into production was a "herculean task" that often stayed in the R&D phase.
*   **The "Born Again" Convert:** The shift to **API-driven AI** (like GPT-3) radicalized his perspective. The removal of complex feature engineering and infrastructure allows developers to focus on the output rather than the "plumbing".
*   **Right Place, Right Time:** Hex’s "cellular" notebook format turned out to be the perfect architecture for **agentic tasks**, as the iterative nature of cells maps directly to how AI agents reason and execute steps.

### **Strategic Product Development in the AI Era**
*   **Avoid "Faster Horse" Features:** Barry reflects on a period of "innovator’s dilemma" where Hex spent time building legacy BI features (like those found in Tableau) to satisfy existing customer requests instead of pushing purely into AI-driven capabilities.
*   **Don't Engineer Around Model Limitations:** A key lesson learned was that spending heavy engineering resources to optimize for current model flaws is often a waste of time. Rapid improvements in models often make complex, proprietary "hacks" obsolete overnight.
*   **Build Durable Frameworks:** Instead of "chasing the local maximum" of current models, teams should build **durable frameworks** (e.g., search infrastructure and context retrieval) that will automatically become more powerful as the underlying agents get smarter.

### **The Changing Paradigm of Business Intelligence**
*   **Dashboards are Jumping-Off Points, Not Destinations:** Traditional BI tools often fail because dashboards raise more questions than they answer, yet the friction to get follow-up answers from a data team is too high.
*   **Opening the "Funnel" of Curiosity:** AI reduces the friction of data exploration, allowing more people to move from "trivia" (what happened?) to "insight" (why did it happen?).
*   **Infinite Demand for Insight:** Barry disputes the idea that AI will replace data scientists. He argues that because there is an infinite demand for answers, AI will simply allow the same number of people to provide **way more software and way more answers** rather than reducing staff.

### **Leadership and "Commitment Engineering"**
*   **Talk to Customers Constantly:** Barry advocates for "Commitment Engineering," where engineers and PMs are fanatical about customer conversations. 
*   **The "Browser Tab" Test:** A crucial insight for product builders is to observe what users *actually* do. Barry recalls a lesson where looking at a user's open browser tabs revealed they were still using a legacy tool they claimed to have replaced, highlighting a failure in the new product's utility.
*   **AI as a Prototyping Partner:** On a personal level, Barry uses AI tools like **Cursor** to prototype ideas. While he is no longer a production coder, AI allows him to build intuition and have sharper technical conversations with his team.

**Connection to Previous Sessions:**
This discussion mirrors previous themes regarding the **immaturity of the IT industry** (Session 2) and the **CDO's struggle to prove value** (Session 3). Barry echoes the sentiment that data has traditionally been a "cost center" because its value is intangible, but he believes AI makes data value "tangible" by allowing anyone in the organization to pursue their curiosity and get immediate answers. Additionally, his use of AI as a companion for "hacking around" aligns with Maggie Wolf’s advice (Session 4) to use AI as an accelerant for learning and experimentation.
