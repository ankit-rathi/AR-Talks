Your current version sounds like:

> “I asked someone for help and updated documentation.”

That’s too small for the situation you described.

What you *actually* have is:

* Governance rejection
* Technical debt exposure
* Executive visibility
* Time pressure
* Cross-boundary collaboration
* Influencing architecture narrative

That’s high-stakes. Let’s elevate it.

# 🔎 What’s Weak in Your Current Version

1. No tension described clearly
2. No clarity on risk
3. You sound reactive, not proactive
4. “Reached out to one member” sounds tactical, not collaborative
5. No visible team benefit
6. No measurable impact

# 🔥 What Makes This a Strong Connected Story

This situation demonstrates:

* Respecting governance rather than bypassing it
* Seeking guidance instead of escalating defensively
* Aligning delivery urgency with architectural integrity
* Turning rejection into collaboration
* Building trust with DAF

That’s textbook Connected behavior.

# ⭐ Stronger Framing (Upgraded Version)

### **S – Situation**

Our XYZ HLSD was rejected by the Data Architecture Forum due to legacy technical debt embedded in the design.

This was a high-visibility executive-facing application with tight delivery timelines.
The rejection created risk of delay and stakeholder escalation.

---

### **T – Task**

I needed to:

* Address DAF concerns without derailing timelines
* Avoid confrontation or governance bypass
* Maintain credibility with architecture leadership
* Ensure the project moved forward responsibly

---

### **A – Action**

Instead of escalating or pushing back, I:

* Proactively reached out to a DAF committee member to understand the core concerns
* Sought clarity on documentation gaps and expectations
* Worked collaboratively to reframe the design narrative
* Explicitly documented:

  * Existing technical debt
  * Risk mitigation approach
  * Phased remediation roadmap aligned with DAF principles
* Socialized the revised approach internally before resubmission to ensure alignment

I positioned the design not as “perfect,” but as “transparent and committed to improvement.”

---

### **R – Result**

* The revised HLSD was approved in the subsequent DAF review
* Project timelines were preserved
* Trust improved between delivery and architecture teams
* Set a precedent for transparent technical debt documentation in future submissions

# 💎 Why This Version Is Stronger

Now it shows:

✔ Cross-boundary collaboration
✔ Respect for governance
✔ Emotional intelligence
✔ Constructive engagement under pressure
✔ Long-term relationship building

This is no longer “I asked for help.”
It becomes:

> “I strengthened collaboration between delivery and architecture under executive pressure.”

---

# 🚀 To Make It Even More Powerful

Add one of these if true:

* Was there initial frustration in your team about rejection?
* Did you calm stakeholders?
* Did you influence others to adopt similar transparency?
* Did DAF acknowledge your approach?

That would elevate this to senior-leadership level.

---

# Brutally Honest Assessment

This is one of your strongest people-centric stories so far.

It shows:

* Maturity
* Diplomacy
* Strategic collaboration
* Governance alignment

Much better Connected story than your technical examples.
