This is your moment.

For a **Principal Data Engineer → Data Management** internal move, your introduction must:

* Show evolution (not job-hopping)
* Show intentionality (not randomness)
* Show increasing leverage
* Show alignment with Customer First + Data Governance
* Position you as someone who understands the full data lifecycle

It must sound like a **strategic progression**, not a résumé summary.

Here’s how you “kill it.”

# 🔥 2–3 Minute Principal-Level Introduction

> I started my career in 2005 as a SQL developer, very close to the business — writing queries to answer operational and reporting questions. That’s where I first learned how much impact data clarity has on decision-making.
>
> In 2007, I moved into ETL and BI development, building data warehouse pipelines and dashboards. That phase helped me understand how fragile insights can be if upstream data isn’t structured well. I began seeing data not just as numbers, but as a lifecycle — ingestion, transformation, modeling, and consumption.
>
> In 2012, I transitioned into a data architect role, where I became responsible for broader data lifecycle management — thinking about standards, modeling, integration patterns, and long-term scalability. That’s when I started appreciating governance and structural thinking at an enterprise level.
>
> In 2016, I moved into data science because AI and advanced analytics were emerging rapidly, and I wanted to work closer to customer-impacting solutions. That experience reinforced a critical lesson — no matter how advanced the models are, their effectiveness is directly limited by data quality and consistency.
>
> In 2022, I intentionally moved back into data engineering. I saw that as AI adoption accelerates, foundational data engineering becomes even more critical. Garbage in, garbage out is not theoretical — it’s operational reality. I wanted to work on high-impact systemic problems rather than just downstream outputs.
>
> Now, I see data management as the next logical step in that progression. In a customer-first bank, trusted data is not optional — it’s foundational. Strong data quality, governance, lineage, and ownership directly affect regulatory compliance, operational efficiency, and ultimately customer trust.
>
> Given my exposure across analytics, architecture, data science, and engineering, I feel well-positioned to contribute at the foundational layer — strengthening standards, improving data reliability, and enabling the broader organization to innovate responsibly.

# Delivery Advice (Very Important)

Tone:
Calm. Reflective. Intentional.

Pace:
Not rushed. Slight pauses after major transitions.

Don’t:

* Sound defensive about role switches.
* Over-explain technical detail.
* Sound like you’re escaping your current team.

You are evolving, not escaping.

# If You Want to Make It Even Stronger

At the end, optionally add:

> “So for me, this move is less about changing roles and more about moving closer to the foundational layer where I believe long-term value is created.”

That line hits hard.
