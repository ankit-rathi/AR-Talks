## 1️⃣ How to build an advisory profile WITHOUT violating your contract

Your rule of thumb should be:

> **Teach thinking publicly. Apply thinking privately.**

You must **not**:

* sell services
* pitch externally
* advise specific companies
* monetize your work (yet)

You **can**:

* publish educational content
* share frameworks
* build intellectual assets
* help your own organization openly

### What your “free brand” should look like

You are positioning as:

> “Someone who helps people think clearly about Data & AI decisions.”

Not:

* “AI consultant”
* “LLM expert”
* “Growth hacker”

This is safe, respected, and future-proof.

### Concrete activities (all compliant)

✅ **Publish your Visual Notebook**

* Book (educational)
* GitHub (markdown narratives)
* Visual notes (PDFs)

No pricing. No lead capture. No CTA.

✅ **YouTube Shorts**

* Concept-level explanations
* No tool demos
* No company-specific advice

✅ **Internal enablement**

* Lunch & learn
* Internal wiki
* Community posts (Engage)

This builds **reputation without commercialization**.

Think of this as **laying dry wood**, not lighting a fire yet.

## 2️⃣ Inside the Org: the *right* role to move toward

Given:

* regulated environment
* sensitive data
* AI scrutiny
* restructuring pressure

The **most appropriate internal destination** is NOT “Head of AI”.

It is one of these (titles vary):

### 🎯 Best-fit internal aspiration roles

#### 1. **Principal / Distinguished Data & AI Architect**

* Enterprise-wide view
* Design authority
* Tradeoff ownership
* Governance-aware

This fits your systems thinking perfectly.

#### 2. **AI Strategy / AI Enablement Lead**

* Focus: *when and how to use AI*
* AI literacy
* Build vs buy decisions
* Risk framing

This aligns directly with your notebook.

#### 3. **Data & AI Governance / Risk Advisor (Tech-side)**

* Bridges tech + compliance
* Explains implications, not policies
* Very rare skill set

This role becomes *more valuable*, not less.

👉 You don’t need to jump immediately.
👉 You need to **grow into one of these shapes**.

## 3️⃣ Year-by-Year Transition Map (Realistic & Low-Risk)

### 🟢 Year 0–1: Consolidation & Visibility (Now → 12 months)

**Primary identity**

> VP Data Engineer + Systems Thinker

**What you do**

* Restart internal posting (Engage)
* Share 1 visual note per 2–3 weeks
* Run 1–2 internal sessions on:

  * “What AI can’t do”
  * “Decision-first AI”
  * “Why governance matters”

**Skills to sharpen**

* AI risk & failure modes
* LLM system architecture (conceptual)
* Governance vocabulary
* Cost & tradeoff articulation

**Outcome**

* People start tagging you as:

  > “Let’s ask him before we do this”

This is the inflection point.

---

### 🟡 Year 1–2: Scope Expansion (12–24 months)

**Primary identity**

> Senior technical leader with advisory pull

**What you do**

* Ask to be involved in:

  * AI reviews
  * platform evaluations
  * cross-team design discussions
* Co-author internal guidance (even informally)

**Skills to build**

* Executive communication
* Tradeoff framing
* Risk narratives
* “No” with reasoning

**Internal move possibility**

* Informal role change
* Matrixed advisory responsibilities
* Title may not change yet — that’s okay

**Outcome**

* You influence decisions beyond your team
* Less hands-on delivery, more design & review

---

### 🟠 Year 2–3: Formal Recognition (24–36 months)

**Primary identity**

> Enterprise Data & AI advisor (internal)

**What changes**

* You are explicitly invited early
* You shape direction, not execution
* You review systems rather than build them

**Possible titles**

* Principal Architect
* AI Strategy Lead
* Data & AI Advisor

**External positioning**

* Your book is out
* Your content is referenced
* People *recognize your thinking*, not your employer

Still no monetization.

---

### 🔵 Year 3–4: Optionality Opens

Now you have **choices**, not pressure.

You can:

* stay internal (stable, senior, respected)
* take a sabbatical
* move to a broader industry role
* or **prepare for advisory transition**

This is when:

* People start asking “Can you help us?”
* You politely say:

  > “Not currently, but happy to share my thinking publicly.”

That sentence alone builds demand.

---

### 🟣 Year 4–5: Clean Transition (If & Only If You Want)

By now:

* Your contract constraints are manageable
* Your identity is established
* You’re not “starting from zero”

Your advisory launch becomes:

* quiet
* selective
* reputation-led

No cold outreach.
No hustling.

---

## What NOT to do (important)

❌ Don’t brand yourself as “consultant” early
❌ Don’t monetize too soon
❌ Don’t over-post
❌ Don’t chase AI hype topics
❌ Don’t position against your employer

You’re playing a **long, elegant game**.

---

## Final honest assessment

You’re not transitioning *out* of your role.

You’re transitioning **above it**.

From:

> “Someone who delivers systems”

To:

> “Someone who shapes how systems are chosen, designed, and governed.”

That transition is rare — and very valuable.
