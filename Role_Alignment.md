## First: get your intent right (internally)

Go in with this mindset:

> “I want to be maximally useful to the organisation **at this level**, not protect my comfort zone.”

If you sound like you’re:

* avoiding people
* clinging to hands-on work
* negotiating workload

you’ll lose credibility.

If you sound like you’re:

* optimising risk
* clarifying ownership
* protecting delivery quality

you’ll gain trust.

## The structure of the conversation (45–60 mins)

### 1️⃣ Open with alignment, not concern (5 mins)

You start by **agreeing with the direction**, not questioning it.

**What to say (use this almost verbatim):**

> “I want to start by saying I’m aligned with the direction — taking more ownership around design, governance, and team leadership makes sense given where the program is heading.”

This immediately removes defensiveness.

---

### 2️⃣ State the real risk you’re trying to avoid (10 mins)

Frame it as an **organisational risk**, not a personal one.

> “Where I want your help is making sure the role doesn’t drift into something that looks busy but doesn’t actually reduce risk or improve outcomes.”

Then be specific:

> “At my level, I think the biggest value I can add is in architectural judgment, technical quality, and early risk detection — not day-to-day administration or being in every stakeholder loop.”

This signals maturity.

---

### 3️⃣ Propose a *clear role definition* (this is the core)

Bring **structure**, not complaints.

You can say:

> “I’ve been thinking about how to define this role cleanly so it scales — I wanted to run this framing by you.”

Then present it like this:

**My primary ownership should be:**

* Architecture and design authority
* Data standards and governance
* Technical decision-making and trade-offs
* Mentoring senior engineers and reviewers
* Final sign-off on technical deliverables

**And I’d like to consciously minimise:**

* Day-to-day task tracking
* Low-value recurring status meetings
* Detailed admin that others can own

> “That way, I stay close enough to the tech to make good decisions, while freeing bandwidth for the things that actually reduce delivery risk.”

This is the *money moment*.

---

### 4️⃣ Address stakeholder management head-on (don’t dodge it)

This is where many senior ICs fail — they sound evasive. Don’t.

Say this instead:

> “I’m absolutely comfortable being accountable to stakeholders — especially around expectations, trade-offs, and risks.
> What I want to avoid is becoming a message relay or bottleneck when others can handle execution-level updates.”

Then add:

> “If we’re aligned, I’d like to focus stakeholder conversations on *why* we’re doing something and *what risks we’re managing*, not *how every task is progressing*.”

That reframes stakeholder work as **leadership**, not admin.

---

### 5️⃣ Ask a calibrating question (crucial)

End with a question that invites partnership:

> “Does this definition of the role match what *you* were hoping I’d focus on — or are there gaps you want me to explicitly own?”

This:

* shows openness
* gives them room to adjust
* prevents silent misalignment

---

## What good signs look like

You’ll know it’s going well if your manager says things like:

* “Yes, that’s exactly what we need from you”
* “I don’t need you in the weeds”
* “We should delegate more of the admin”
* “You should be setting direction, not tracking tasks”

If that happens → **lock it in with a follow-up email** summarising the role.

---

## Yellow flags (not red yet)

* “Let’s see how it evolves”
* “For now, just handle it”
* “We need everyone to pitch in”

If you hear this, respond with:

> “Understood — can we review and tighten this in, say, 6–8 weeks once patterns emerge?”

You’re planting a checkpoint.

---

## What NOT to say (important)

Avoid these phrases completely:

* “I prefer staying technical”
* “I’m not great with stakeholders”
* “This is too much admin”
* “I don’t want to manage”

All of these signal **avoidance**, not leadership.

---

## One last mental reframe (for you)

This conversation is not about protecting your past identity.

It’s about **designing a role that you can perform well for the next 5–7 years** without burnout or obsolescence.

That’s exactly what senior leadership *should* do.
