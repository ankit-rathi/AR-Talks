## Book Outline (Draft)
Short, evergreen, highly practical, with just enough code/examples to make it actionable.  

### Part I: Foundations of a Data-First Mindset

#### 1. Why Data and AI Projects Fail
- Common pitfalls: technical debt, poor data quality, lack of strategy  
- Stories from industry disasters  
- The “anti-hype” manifesto  

#### 2. Thinking in Systems: The Lifecycle of Data and AI
- End-to-end view: ingestion → processing → modeling → serving → feedback loops  
- Balancing innovation with reliability  

#### 3. Best Practices Blueprint: A Preview
- Overview of the book’s frameworks and checklists  
- How to use this playbook effectively

### Part II: Building Strong Data Foundations

#### 4. Data Engineering Done Right
- Principles: quality, observability, governance  
- Trade-offs: batch vs. streaming, ELT vs. ETL  
- Real-world data architecture examples  

#### 5. Modern Data Platforms and Tooling
- Navigating tool sprawl pragmatically  
- Vendor-agnostic principles (cloud vs. on-prem vs. hybrid)  

#### 6. Data Quality and Reliability as a Culture
- Testing, monitoring, lineage, documentation  
- Practical frameworks (Great Expectations, Monte Carlo, etc.)
