People are telling others not to learn coding because “AI will do it for you.” 

I think this will turn out to be some of the worst career advice of our time.

This isn’t the first time we’ve heard this.

In the 1960s, when programming moved from punchcards to terminals, it became easier—and yet, that’s when a Nobel laureate predicted programming would go extinct.

He was wrong.

Today, we’ve gone from assembly to Python, from typing every line manually to AI-assisted coding. 

And every step has made coding easier—not less important.

As it gets easier, more people should do it. Not fewer.

If you want to work with AI, you need to be able to guide it. 

And that means understanding the language of software.

You don’t have to become a software engineer. 

But if you can code a little; or at least understand what the code does; you can use tools like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, or other LLMs in a much more powerful way.

Learning to code today isn’t about building the next Facebook. 

It’s about getting AI to do exactly what you want.

If you want to stay relevant in an AI-powered world, learn to speak the language of machines.
