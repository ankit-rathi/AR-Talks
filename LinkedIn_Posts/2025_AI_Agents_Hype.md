Everyone wants to build AI Agents.

But no one wants to build a solid foundation.

The buzzwords are flying—RAG, MCP, AutoGPTs, AI Agents.

Post a LinkedIn update with those in the headline and you'll have 50 comments before your coffee gets cold.

But ask someone to sit down and understand the fundamentals of data pipelines, metadata, model evaluation, or data governance—and suddenly, it’s crickets.

The irony?

You can’t build strong AI systems without understanding how data flows, how models learn, and how systems scale.

Skipping fundamentals in tech is like building a flying car without learning to drive.

If you're serious about mastering Data & AI, take the unsexy route first. Learn the basics.

That's what will separate the builders from the bandwagoners.

The hype will fade. Fundamentals won’t.
