Backbencher by choice. Frontbencher by compulsion. 

And somewhere in between, I figured out how learning actually works.

I’ve had a taste of both sides of the classroom.

Front benches taught me discipline.

Back benches taught me curiosity, creativity, and freedom.

And over time, I started questioning more than just math problems.

In a world evolving faster than ever, our education system feels stuck in a time loop.

Churning out “standard” products. 

Top-tier degrees, yet struggling for jobs.

Bright minds, but boxed skillsets.

That’s why I don’t want my kids to take syllabus and marks too seriously.

Not because education is bad. But because it's incomplete.

For a while, my better half (a proud front-bencher of her time) didn’t quite agree.

But it seems we’ve successfully de-brainwashed each other and found middle ground.

The future belongs to those who can adapt, learn continuously, and think independently.

And that’s not always found on page 42 of the textbook.
