I didn’t leave Machine Learning / AI.

I just walked out quietly… when the hype got louder than the results.

Back in 2014, ML was the cool kid on the block.

Algorithms were sexy. Research papers felt revolutionary.

Everyone wanted to “do AI”.

And honestly, I loved riding the hype cycle.

But reality hits hard when most of your models never see daylight.

Feasibility fails.

Data’s missing, irrelevant, or just plain noisy.

Patterns? Nowhere.

And the leadership?

Sold on shiny demos and buzzwords, while we were left explaining why half the use cases couldn’t (and shouldn’t) be deployed.

Then it hit me—

The problem wasn’t the models.

The real challenge was upstream: data.

Dirty, scattered, untracked, ungoverned, broken-at-the-source data.


The stuff no one wants to deal with… but everything depends on.

That’s when I made the switch to Data Engineering.

Not because it’s glamorous — but because it’s foundational.

Because without robust pipelines, orchestration, and storage, ML is just a fancy prototype stuck in a Jupyter notebook.

And honestly?

It made more sense long term.

Too many ML folks. Too few real ML problems.

Too few DEs. Too many real data problems.

In DE, I found something rarer: predictable impact.

Less hype, more hands-on value.

Less spotlight, more respect.

Not cutting-edge. But mission-critical.

So no — I didn’t “quit” ML.

I upgraded my path.

And in 2025, I don’t regret it one bit.

You don’t need limelight to grow.

Sometimes, the backstage work builds the entire show.
