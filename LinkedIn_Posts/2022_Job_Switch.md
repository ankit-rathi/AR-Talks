I used to be aggressive in everything; my career, workouts, goals.

A few years back, I hit a wall.

Demanding job. Constant deadlines. High expectations.

On the outside, I was performing.
But inside, I was exhausted.

The irony?
I was doing yoga, jogging, and gyming; trying to stay healthy.

Yet my health reports told a different story.
Stress was quietly undoing all my efforts.

That was a wake-up call.

I paused. Reflected. And eventually, I left that high-pressure role.

Not to do something bigger. Just to breathe.

These days, I don’t chase much.

I don’t overtrain. I don’t overthink.

I’m not doing anything aggressively; and strangely, I’ve never felt better.

Work is balanced. Health is improving. Mind is calm.

Here’s what I’ve learned:

Sometimes, slowing down isn’t giving up.

It’s choosing sustainability over burnout.

Discipline is valuable, but alignment is non-negotiable.

If you’re running hard, just make sure you’re not running yourself into the ground.
