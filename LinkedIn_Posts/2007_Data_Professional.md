At first, I just wanted a chill job where I didn’t have to do much.

In my first job, I wasn’t really sure what I wanted to do with my life.

I started preparing for MBA entrances; because that’s what ambitious people did.

But it didn’t feel right.

Then I thought of doing PMP and becoming a project manager.

I assumed bosses just gave instructions and relaxed the rest of the day.
That seemed like a great life.

But over time, reality hit.

I wasn’t great at everything, but I was decent at tech.

And I realized I actually liked working with data, solving problems, and writing SQL.

I slowly dropped all the other plans and doubled down on becoming a data professional.

Today, I’m still learning. Still evolving. 

Sometimes, I still feel like an imposter but that is OK I guess.

At least I’m on a journey and building a career that feels right for me.

Now I reflect that:

You don’t have to figure everything out on day one.

Just be honest about what you enjoy; and keep moving in that direction.
